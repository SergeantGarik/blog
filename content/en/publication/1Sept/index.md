The first day of September is not just the start of autumn, but also the long-awaited Knowledge Day. For many students, this day symbolizes new opportunities and discoveries. At the capital university, the atmosphere was particularly exciting: the halls were filled with the laughter and conversation of first-year students who were eagerly awaiting the start of the academic year.

In the morning, senior students greeted the new students at the university entrance with smiles and good wishes. The hosts conducted a ceremonial line-up where congratulations and motivational words from the faculty were shared. Every new student felt like part of a large and friendly family.

After the official part, introductions with teachers and classmates began. The lectures in mathematics and literature opened doors to the world of knowledge that lay ahead. Despite the nervousness, many first-year students noted how quickly they found common ground with each other.

In the evening, after a busy day, students gathered at a caf√©, discussing their impressions and plans for the future. Knowledge Day became not only the beginning of the academic year but also the start of a new chapter in each of their lives. With hope and optimism, they looked forward, ready for new challenges and achievements.
