## About Me

My name is Danila Zhernakov. I was born and raised in Arkhangelsk. I studied at School No. 8, where I developed a passion for history and sports. After finishing school, I moved to Moscow in search of new opportunities. Here, I have been working in the hospitality industry for two years, and I enjoy interacting with people and growing in this field. My family has always supported me: my parents inspired me to take bold steps, and my younger sister has become my faithful friend. Despite the challenges of moving, I feel that I have found my place in the big city and am striving for new achievements.
