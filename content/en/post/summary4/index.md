## What Happened This Week

### 25.09

Today we covered complex topics in differential equations during the lecture. Realized that I need more practice. Decided to change my workplace.

### 27.09

Started working at a new coffee shop! The atmosphere here is incredible, and the customers are very friendly. Even had an interesting conversation with a mathematician!

### 28.09

Gathered with my group to prepare for the upcoming test. Everyone shared their knowledge and methods. The evening at work was busy, but I managed well!

### 29.09

Had a Knowledge Festival at the faculty today! Participated in various contests and quizzes. After work, met some old friends — it was great to reminisce about school days.

### 30.09

Faced some challenges with my studies today — couldn't solve a few problems. Asked my classmates for help, and they were happy to assist. Work was also tough, but I got through it!

### 01.10

Reflecting on the month: studied hard, worked, and met some great people. I feel like I'm growing and developing! Hoping the next month will be just as eventful!
