## What Happened This Week

### 01.09

Today was my first day at the university! So many new faces and impressions. I was a bit nervous during the Mathematical Analysis lecture, but the professor turned out to be very friendly. In the evening, I worked at the café and met some interesting people!

### 03.09

Today, my classmates and I decided to meet for coffee after classes. We discussed the upcoming exams and shared our study methods. I worked until late in the evening, but it didn’t stop me from feeling positive!
