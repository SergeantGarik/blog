## What Happened This Week

### 20.09
Took a break from studying and went to the gym. Physical activity helps me unwind. In the evening, worked, and my colleagues joined in a conversation about sports!

### 22.09
Met with my Mathematical Analysis professor for a consultation. He suggested some useful resources. After work at the caf√©, we talked about his favorite books!

### 23.09
Got together with my group to work on a project. Discussed interesting problems. In the evening, there was a rush of customers at work, which only added to the adrenaline!

### 24.09
Today is a day off! Finally took a break from studying and working. Went to a museum exhibition, got inspired by new ideas. Back to the grind tomorrow!
