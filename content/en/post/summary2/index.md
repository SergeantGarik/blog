## What Happened This Week

### 16.09

Today was the first quiz on Linear Algebra. I was a bit nervous, but I think I did okay. In the evening, back at work, but thoughts about the quiz keep lingering!

### 17.09

Spent the whole day at the library. So many books! Found some useful materials for preparing for the next quiz. Work at the caf√© was calm, and I even managed to read a bit.
